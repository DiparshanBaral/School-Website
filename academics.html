      <h2>Junior School</h2>
      <h3>Kindergarten to Grade III</h3>
      <p>Amar's Junior wing, with approximately 200 students, functions as a necessary educational extension of home learning. The teaching here is largely informal with suitable breaks for naps, snacks, and play for our tiny tots. Specially designed aids enhance the psycho-motor skills of children at school.</p>
      <P>Over the primary year schooling, we carefully guide our very young starters to shape their formative brains enabling them to become complete human beings. Our focus is on learning by doing, particularly through useful play and pleasurable activities. Incorporation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) creatively constitutes a vital aspect of Progressive Education. In this method of teaching-learning, students take an active role in learning, whereas the teachers act as facilitators in the learning process. Experts have specially trained Amar's team of teachers.</P>
      <p>Students are provided with opportunities to learn through hands-on activities, group discussions, collaborative work, field trips, sharing their work with the class, and taking constructive opinions of peers. All this helps them to develop their problem solving, critical thinking and social skills. They are taught to link cross-curricular topics to understand the larger picture of their education. Thereafter, students showcase their learning acquired in field trips, class work, and homework during regularly held Project Days. Parents, guardians, and invitees from selected schools attend these important learning events.</p>
      <p>The result of all this hard work of our team of dedicated teachers is evident predominantly in the students' personal development and remarkable educational progress. They learn by doing, and by being actively involved in whatever they do. Notably, they greatly enjoy their learning experience, and that is why their understanding and retention of different subject matter is exceptional. Their language ability improves remarkably, and they get to converse fluently and accurately in diverse situations: academic, personal, and social. This impacts their writing as well, enhancing and enriching their written assignments. As they grow up with us, our students become responsive, sensitive, and empathetic. Above all, Amar students exude self-confidence. </p>

      <h2>Middle School</h2>
      <h3>Grade IV to VII</h3>
      <p>The middle wing at Amar English School comprises Grades IV-VII with approximately 200 students. A Block Coordinator is in charge of all the activities. Considering their future learning and other needs, we focus on values that are needed for their adulthood, offer technology that will help them become professionals, and integrate their lessons to make them understand the interdependent and multi-disciplinary aspects of education, and modern life.</p>
      <P>While progressive learning continues, students develop the knowledge & skills needed for their transition to higher classes and to inculcate the habit of studying independently. At this level, students are encouraged to explore and nurture their inherent talents. In addition, exposure to varied co-curricular and extracurricular activities help them to hone their interests and learning abilities.</P>
      <p>Students actively participate in varied classroom activities, learning new skills and developing self-confidence. Furthermore, through participation in various intra- and inter-school competitions, students are encouraged to socialize extensively, develop team spirit, and strengthen their sense of community.</p>
      <p>Focusing on the holistic development of the students, field trips, community activities, picnics, house presentations, and many other activities are incorporated in the school curriculum, which provide them with ample opportunities to observe, learn, and participate. Emphasis is laid on academic excellence supported by the assured development of life skills to assist our students become responsible citizens and good human beings. We regularly encourage students to participate in classroom activities and in the decision-making process so as to assist their overall growth.</p>
      <p>Our practical approach to teaching, and participatory approach to conducting activities, has been fruitful in inculcating the right learning practices. Also, regular feedback and interactions with the students' parents, or guardians, ensure the child's continued overall development, as well as availability of full learning support, wherever and whenever needed.</p>

      <h2>Senior School</h2>
      <h3>Grade VIII to X</h3>
      <p>The senior block: Grades VIII to X enrolls approximately 150 students. The students in this age group are in their formative years, laying the foundation for facing bigger challenges and real-life tests. Since its inception, Triyog has believed in the holistic development of students. Our rigorous Secondary Education Examination (SEE) preparatory curriculum provides students with the opportunity to achieve praiseworthy results. The curriculum combines compulsory and optional subjects, and prepares a student to take up the State Level board exam, the SEE.</p>
      <p>Innovative methods are applied wherever possible in addition to the broad-based and time-tested traditional methods of teaching. The school curriculum integrates cognitive, working, solidarity and recreational activities. Core skills and values are infused throughout this period. Various co-curricular activities are given to students, widening their horizons. An exposure to an array of international, inter-school, and intra-school activities provide an opportunity for education through creative, cooperative, and productive work, adding to the capacity-building of the new generation. The School works closely with the local community for long-lasting and sustainable development activities.</p>
      <p>These special activities include different types of community work, field trips, and excursions, which emphasize and promote critical inquiry besides giving the youngsters a firsthand experience of life. A regular interaction with parents provides an opportunity to get feedback for constructive changes. Teenage turmoil can be best overcome with our counseling sessions that are provided to the students either on one-to-one basis, or in groups. It is a matter of immense pride for us to see our ex-students accepted by renowned colleges and universities all over the world. They are carving a niche for themselves in their respective fields. Triyog is dedicated to give the best possible services to its students, community, and society, in the years to come, like it has done so far, and we remain true to our words.</p>
      <p>Since we believe in result oriented practical ways of learning we provide several opportunities through field visits and seminars to our students. The main objective is to provide quality education at affordable costs and train the youths for making them capable to lead the society. Amar English School also offers scholarships to the outstanding students who meet criteria as specified by the school.</p>
